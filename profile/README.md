# SigmaCamp Brazil

In 2012, scientists from the United States created SigmaCamp with the goal of sparking students interest in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). Since its inaugural edition, the event has been a success, featuring hands-on activities and classes taught by professors from top North American universities.

Initially, SigmaCamp was held exclusively in Connecticut, USA. This changed when its founders discovered the Etapa System methodology and recognized shared educational values. This alignment led to a partnership, and in 2024, SigmaCamp arrived in Brazil as ETAPA SigmaCamp, inspiring young talents from across the country.
